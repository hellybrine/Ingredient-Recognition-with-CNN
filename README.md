# Ingredient-Recognition-with-CNN
This project is a recognition system utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can input images which are then analyzed by the CNN model to accurately identify the item. Upon identification, the system offers a selection of recipe suggestions tailored to the detected ingredient, complete with a cooking procedures.

# Abstract
This project is an Artificial Intelligence-based image recognition system designed to use images of fruits and vegetables taken by the user's and to recognize them. The primary goal of this research is to develop computer-aided technical solutions that enhance and improve the accuracy of recognizing fruits and vegetables. The proposed system aims to improve the accuracy of identifying fruit and vegetable images captured. This system employs a machine learning techniques from the field of Deep Learning to recognize and classify different categories of fruits and vegetables. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based food image recognition algorithm is used to train an image category classifier.
